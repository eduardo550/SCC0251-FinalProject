## Abstract

In this project we will different steganographic techniques to hide data in digital images. We will compare and contrast techniques in the spatial and frequency domains in regard
to distortion in relation to the original, or cover, image. Our goal will be to learn about the application of Image Steganography as a part of our Image Processing course.

### Techniques

### Application
Image Steganography and Digital Forensics.

### Image samples
Any images would work in this application. For this project, we will sample cover images from the [ALASKA2 Image Steganalysis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/alaska2-image-steganalysis/data) to embed with data of different sizes and types.
