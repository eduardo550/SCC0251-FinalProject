## Abstract

In this project we will develop a Neural Network to detect the presence of hidden data in images and classify the algorithm used to encode it. We will use images taken from multiple sources and embedded with different steganographic methods and develop a model to mimic a late submission to the [ALASKA2 Image Steganalysis][https://www.kaggle.com/c/alaska2-image-steganalysis/overview] Kaggle Competition, using the same success metrics and dataset that were used in the constest. This project will allow us to learn about both Deep Learning applied to images, and Image Steganography as part of our Image Processing course.

### Techniques
Neural Networks for image classification and description.

### Application
Image Steganalysis and Digital Forensics.

### Image samples
We will sample images like stego objects that may or may not have encoded messages, from the kaggle competiton dataset.
