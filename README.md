## Abstract

In this project we will different steganographic techniques to hide data in digital images. We will compare and contrast techniques in the spatial and frequency domains in regard
to distortion in relation to the original, or cover, image. Our goal will be to learn about the application of Image Steganography as a part of our Image Processing course.

### Techniques

### Application
Image Steganography and Digital Forensics.

### Image samples
We will sample images like stego objects that may or may not have encoded messages, from the kaggle competiton dataset.
